## Crypto perpetual contract
- Every new Crypto `@swap` strategy must declare `context.set_metadata(direction_mode=...)` in `initialize`; accepted values are exactly {_DIRECTION_VALUES}.
- `direction_mode` is strategy capability metadata. `position_side` is the concrete `long` or `short` hedge leg on a position read or order. They are not interchangeable.
- `one_way` means one signed net position. Use `get_position(symbol)` and omit `position_side` from every order. Positive targets open or maintain long exposure; negative targets open or maintain short exposure; close the current position before opening the opposite side.
- For `long_only`, `short_only`, `both`, and `neutral`, every `get_position(...)` and order call for a swap instrument must explicitly pass `position_side="long"` or `position_side="short"` (a variable resolving to one of those values is also valid).
- In hedge mode, `get_position(symbol)` is not a synthetic net position. Read each owned leg explicitly and test `abs(position.amount)`.
- Short targets use negative quantity, value, or percent while still declaring `position_side="short"`. Closing either leg uses a zero target for that same `position_side`.
- `one_way` requires exchange one-way mode in live trading. `both` and `neutral` require exchange hedge mode. `allow_leverage` remains a separate source permission and must never be multiplied into order sizing.
""",
        repair="""
- For `one_way`, remove `position_side` and implement signed net-position reversal. For all hedge-leg modes, add an explicit valid `position_side` to every Crypto swap position read and order.

## Canonical Supertrend
- Never reimplement Supertrend bands from ATR in generated strategy source. Use the platform series: `indicator("supertrend", symbol, period=period, multiplier=multiplier, output="direction", frequency=frequency)`.
- The returned pandas Series contains warmup `NaN` values. First call `valid_trend = trend.dropna()` and return unless `len(valid_trend) >= 2`.
- A change from a negative previous value to a positive current value is a bullish reversal. A positive-to-negative change is a bearish reversal.
- Read `valid_trend.iloc[-2]` and `valid_trend.iloc[-1]` only after the completed-data length guard. Do not rebuild rolling bands independently on every bar.

## Registered technical factors
- When adding or changing a requested factor, use the canonical factor ID and parameters in its active definition. Do not reimplement it with ad-hoc rolling math.
- Use `indicator(factor_id, symbol, **params)` when previous/current series values are needed for signals. Use `factor(factor_id, symbol, **params)` only when one current scalar value is sufficient.
- `indicator(...)` returns a pandas Series for one output or a DataFrame for multiple outputs. Warmup values may be `NaN`; call `.dropna()` on the selected series and check its length before `.iloc` access.
- Multi-output indicators must select a documented `output` or use the returned DataFrame columns. Never guess output names or parameter aliases.
- For series APIs, use returned DataFrame columns for MACD (`macd`, `macdsignal`, `macdhist`), STOCH (`slowk`, `slowd`), and KDJ (`k`, `d`, `j`); an `output` argument is not a universal Series selector. For scalar `factor`, use the active definition's output enum.
- A definition marked `requested` is a hard requirement for this turn. A definition marked only `existing` is context: preserve a working legacy or TA-Lib call when the user did not ask to change that factor.
""",
        repair="""
- Replace manual implementations of requested registered factors with `indicator(...)` or `factor(...)` using the active factor definition.

## Bidirectional swap behavior
- `direction_mode="both"` means independent long and short hedge legs and requires exchange hedge mode.
- Implement independent long entry, long exit, short entry, and short exit behavior. A long exit is not a short entry, and a short exit is not a long entry.
- Read both legs explicitly with `get_position(symbol, position_side="long")` and `get_position(symbol, position_side="short")` when position state is needed.
- Orders for the long leg pass `position_side="long"`; orders for the short leg pass `position_side="short"`. Target-style short entries use a negative target and short exits use zero.
- A signal reversal may close one leg and open the other, but the source must express those as separate leg-specific intents and must not assume either order filled immediately.

## One-way long/short reversal
- A general long-and-short request means `direction_mode="one_way"` unless the user explicitly requests hedge mode or simultaneous independent legs.
- Read the signed position with `get_position(symbol)` and omit `position_side` from all orders.
- Express reversal as four intents: close short, open long, close long, and open short. Submit the close first and do not assume it filled immediately before opening the opposite side.
- Positive target quantities, values, or percentages represent long exposure; negative targets represent short exposure; zero closes the current net position.

        contract="""
## Stateful order lifecycle
- An order function submits intent; it does not prove a fill. Active states include `unknown`, `queued`, `deferred`, `submitted`, `open`, and `partial`; `partial` is not a completed fill.
- Orders that may be retried, cancelled, reconciled, or used to advance a cycle must pass a stable `client_order_id` of at most 100 characters and retain the returned reference. The ID must be stable for retries of the same logical order but unique across later trading cycles; derive it from the completed-bar timestamp plus side/action instead of reusing one literal forever.
- `get_order_status(reference)` returns a mapping, not a status string. Read `result["status"]` (and, when needed, `filled_quantity`, `filled_notional`, or `fee`). Query with the retained reference and cancel with `cancel_order(reference)`. Treat cancellation as asynchronous.
- Advance strategy state, reuse capital, or open the opposite leg only after both a terminal order state and the synchronized position confirm the result.
- A target crossing zero is close-then-open. Never model it as one immediately filled reversal.
- Supported execution keywords include `reason`, `position_side`, `client_order_id`, `order_type`, `limit_price`, `execution_algo`, `maker_wait_sec`, and `maker_offset_bps`. A limit order requires a positive `limit_price`.
""",
        repair="""
- Add stable, per-logical-order `client_order_id` values to tracked orders and use `get_order_status(reference)["status"]` before advancing state.
- Do not treat `partial`, a submitted order, or a cancel request as a terminal fill.

            "requires": {"trailing_activation_pct": "trailing_stop_pct"},
        },
        contract="""
## Native position protection
- Attach protection to an entry order with `stop_loss_pct`, `take_profit_pct`, `trailing_stop_pct`, `trailing_activation_pct`, and/or `time_limit_seconds`, or call `set_default_protection(...)` inside an executable handler/callback before later entries.
- When protection is requested for Crypto swaps, each required entry leg must carry effective protection directly on its order call (inline keywords or a literal `protection` mapping). The AI validator does not accept `set_default_protection` alone as proof that each swap entry leg is protected.
- Percentage values are decimal ratios: `0.03` means 3%, not 0.03% or 3.
- Use ratios within their bounds: stop loss and trailing stop 0..1; take profit and trailing activation 0..5; time limits are non-negative seconds. Zero disables a rule; activation alone is not protection. `trailing_rebase_on_scale_in` defaults to true and resets the trail and holding clock on scale-in; false preserves an already active trail.
- Signal exits and native protections are different mechanisms. Do not claim fixed stop-loss or take-profit behavior unless executable protection arguments are present.
- Backtest native protection evaluates each bar's open/high/low and can close at the trigger price or a gap opening price, including on an entry fill bar. It is not a close-only signal exit. The default conservative conflict policy prioritizes stop loss, trailing stop, time limit, then take profit. Live protection uses a separate price clock; do not mutate strategy candles to implement it.
""",
        repair="""
- Implement requested stops or take profit with native protection keywords or `set_default_protection`; explanatory comments or parameters alone are insufficient.
- For Crypto swaps, put effective protection directly on every required entry leg; default protection alone does not pass per-leg AI validation.
- Keep percentage values as bounded decimal ratios.

## Restart-safe strategy state

- After restart, reconcile restored state with actual positions and tracked order status before placing another order. A snapshot never replaces the exchange ledger.

## Scheduling and execution timing
- `weekday` uses 1 through 7 with Monday equal to 1. A monthly day beyond the month end resolves to the final day of that month.
- Scheduled callbacks see the previous completed bar and may submit for the current open. `handle_data` sees the newly completed bar and submits for the next bar open.
- Live schedule times use the configured user timezone. Current live runtime does not call `after_trading_end`; critical close behavior belongs in `handle_data` or an explicit schedule.
